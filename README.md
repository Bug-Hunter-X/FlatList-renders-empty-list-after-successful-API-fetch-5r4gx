# React Native FlatList Empty List Bug

This repository demonstrates a common bug in React Native where a FlatList component renders an empty list even after successfully fetching data from an API.  The issue is likely related to data handling or state updates.

## Bug Description

The provided `MyComponent` fetches data from a sample API endpoint.  Although the `ActivityIndicator` is shown while fetching, the FlatList remains empty after the data is loaded. The console shows no errors.

## Solution

The solution involves carefully examining how the data is handled after the API response is received. A common mistake is improper use of states or missing error handling. Check the `bugSolution.js` file for a corrected version.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Run the app on your preferred simulator or device. You should see the empty FlatList.

## Note

This example uses a placeholder API endpoint.  Replace it with a valid API endpoint for testing purposes.
